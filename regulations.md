### 1.8 Commercial Mail Receiving Agencies

#### 1.8.1 Procedures

> The procedures for establishing a commercial mail receiving agency (CMRA) are as follows:
> 
> a.  An addressee may request mail delivery to a CMRA. The CMRA accepts delivery of the mail and holds it for pickup or remails it to the addressee, prepaid with new postage.
> 
> b.  [6-23-19] Each CMRA must register with the Post Office responsible for delivery. Any person who establishes, owns, or manages a CMRA must provide PS Form 1583-A, Application to Act as a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency, to the postmaster (or designee) responsible for the delivery address. The CMRA owner or manager must complete all entries and sign the PS Form 1583-A.
> 
>     The CMRA owner or manager must provide acceptable primary and secondary forms of identification as specified under 608.10.0. These I.D. must contain sufficient information to confirm that the applicant is who he or she claims to be and is traceable to the bearer. The postmaster (or designee) may retain a photocopy of the acceptable form of identification for verification and must list and record on PS Form 1583-A (block 10) sufficient information to identify the two types of acceptable forms of identification presented.
> 
>     Furnishing false information on the application or refusing to provide required information is reason for denying the application. If any information required on PS Form 1583-A changes, the CMRA owner or manager must file a revised application (write "revised" on the form) with the postmaster.
> 
> c.  The postmaster (or designee) must verify the documentation to confirm that the CMRA owner or manager resides at the permanent home address shown on Form 1583-A; witness the signature of the CMRA owner or manager; and sign Form 1583-A. The postmaster must provide the CMRA with a copy of the DMM regulations relevant to the operation of a CMRA. The CMRA owner or manager must sign the Form 1583-A acknowledging receipt of the regulations. The postmaster must file the original of the completed Form 1583-A at the Post Office and provide the CMRA with a duplicate copy.
> 
> d.  A CMRA is authorized to accept the following accountable mail from their customers for mailing at the Post Office: insured, Priority Mail Express, Certified Mail, COD (excluding COD Hold For Pickup), USPS Tracking, and Signature Confirmation mail. The sender (CMRA customer) must present accountable mail items not listed to the Post Office for mailing.

#### 1.8.2 Delivery to CMRA

> Procedures for delivery to a CMRA are as follows:
> 
> a.  [6-23-19] Mail delivery to a CMRA requires that the CMRA owner or manager and each addressee complete and sign PS Form 1583, Application for Delivery of Mail Through Agent. Spouses may complete and sign one PS Form 1583. Each spouse must provide acceptable primary and secondary forms of identification as specified under 608.10.0.
> Any information required on PS Form 1583 that differs for one spouse from information the other provided must be entered in the appropriate box. A parent or guardian may receive delivery of a minor's mail by listing the name(s) of each minor on PS Form 1583 (block 12).
> 
>     The CMRA owner or manager, authorized employee, or a notary public must witness the signature of the addressee. The addressee must complete all entries on PS Form 1583. The CMRA owner or manager must verify the documentation to confirm that the addressee resides or conducts business at the permanent address shown on PS Form 1583. The address is verified if there is no discrepancy between information on the application and the identification presented.
> 
>     If information on the application does not match the identification, the applicant must substantiate to the CMRA that the applicant resides or conducts business at the address shown. A document from a governmental entity or recognized financial institution or a utility bill with the applicant's name and current permanent address may be used for such purpose.
> 
>     If the applicant is unable to substantiate the address, the CMRA must deny the application. Furnishing false information on the application or refusing to provide required information is reason for withholding the addressee's mail from delivery to the agent and returning it to the sender.
> 
>     If any information required on PS Form 1583 changes, the addressee must file a revised application (write "revised" on the form) with the CMRA. The addressee must provide acceptable primary and secondary forms of identification as specified under 608.10.0. These forms must contain sufficient information to confirm that the applicant is who he or she claims to be and is traceable to the bearer.
> 
>     The CMRA owner or manager may retain a photocopy of the identification for verification purposes. The CMRA owner or manager must list and record on PS Form 1583 (block 8) sufficient information to identify the acceptable primary and secondary forms of identification presented and write on PS Form 1583 (block 3) the complete CMRA delivery address used to deliver mail to the addressee.
> 
> b.  A CMRA must not modify or alter Form 1583 or Form 1583-A. Modified or altered forms are invalid and the addressee's mail must be returned to sender in accordance with USPS regulations.
> 
> c.  The CMRA must provide the original of completed Forms 1583 to the postmaster. This includes revised Forms 1583 submitted by an addressee based on information changes to the original Form 1583 (write "revised" on form). The CMRA must maintain duplicate copies of completed Forms 1583 on file at the CMRA business location. The Forms 1583 must be available at all times for examination by postal representatives and postal inspectors. The postmaster must file the original Forms 1583 first by CMRA and then alphabetically by the addressee's last name at the station, branch, or Post Office. The postmaster files the original Forms 1583 without verifying the address of residence or firm shown on Forms 1583. The postmaster is required to verify only when the postmaster receives a request by the Postal Inspector in Charge, or when there is reason to believe that the addressee's mail may be, or is being, used for unlawful purposes.
> 
> d.  When the agency relationship between the CMRA and the addressee terminates, the CMRA must write the date of termination on its duplicate copy of Form 1583. The CMRA must notify the Post Office of termination dates through the quarterly updates (due January 15th, April 15th, July 15th, and October 15th) of the alphabetical list of customers cross-referenced to the CMRA addressee delivery designations. The alphabetical list must contain all new customers, current customers, and those customers who terminated within the past 6 months, including the date of termination. The CMRA must retain the endorsed duplicate copies of Forms 1583 for at least 6 months after the termination date. Forms 1583 filed at the CMRA business location must be available at all times for examination by postal representatives.
> 
> e.  A CMRA must represent its delivery address designation for the intended addressees by the use of "PMB" (private mailbox) or the alternative "#" sign. Mailpieces must bear a delivery address that contains at least the following elements, preferably in the following format:
>
>     1.  Line 1: Intended addressee's name or other identification. Examples: JOE DOE or ABC CO.
>
>     2.  Line 2: "PMB" and number or the alternative "#" (pound sign) and number. Examples: PMB 234 or #234.
>
>     3.  Line 3: Street number and name or Post Office box number or rural route designation and number. Examples: 10 MAIN ST STE 11 or PO BOX 34 or RR 1 BOX 12.
>
>     4.  Line 4: City, state, and ZIP Code (5-digit or ZIP+4). Example: HERNDON VA 22071-2716.
>
> f.  As an alternate to the format presented in e., the following format may be used:
>
>     1.  Line 1: Intended addressee's name or other identification. Examples: JOE DOE or ABC CO.
>
>     2.  Line 2: Street number and name or Post Office box number and "PMB" and number or the alternative "#" (pound sign) and number. Examples: 10 MAIN ST PMB 234 or #234 or PO BOX 34 PMB 234 or #234.
>
>     3.  Line 3: City, state, and ZIP Code (5-digit or ZIP+4). Example: HERNDON VA 22071-2716.
>
> g.  As an exception to the formats presented in e. and f., when the CMRA's physical address contains a secondary address element (e.g., rural route box number, "suite," "#," or other term), the CMRA customer must use "PMB" in the three-line format. It is not permissible to combine the secondary address element of the physical location of the CMRA address and the CMRA customer private mailbox number, e.g., 10 MAIN ST STE 11-234. The CMRA must write the complete CMRA delivery address used to deliver mail to each individual addressee or firm on the Form 1583 (block 3). The USPS may return mail without a proper address to the sender endorsed "Undeliverable as Addressed, Missing PMB or # Sign." The three-line format must be as follows:
>
>     1.  JOE DOE
>         10 MAIN ST STE 11 PMB 234
>         HERNDON VA 22071-2716
>
>     2.  JOE DOE
>         RR 12 BOX 512 PMB 234
>         HERNDON VA 22071-2716
>
> h.  The CMRA must be in full compliance with 1.8.1 through 1.8.3 and other applicable postal requirements to receive delivery of mail from the Post Office.
>
> i.  The postmaster may, with the next higher level approval and notification to the Postal Inspector-In-Charge, suspend delivery to a CMRA that, after proper notification, fails to comply with 1.8.1 through 1.8.3 or other applicable postal requirements. The proper notification must be in writing outlining the specific violation(s) with a reasonable time to comply.
>
> j.  With the approval of suspension of delivery, the postmaster must provide the CMRA with written notification of the effective date and the reason(s). If the CMRA fails to comply by the effective date, return mail to the sender endorsed "Delivery Suspended to Commercial Mail Receiving Agency."

#### 1.8.3 Addressee and CMRA Agreement

> In delivery of the mail to the CMRA, the addressee and the CMRA agree that:
> 
> a.  When the agency relationship between the CMRA and the addressee terminates, neither the addressee nor the CMRA will file a change-of-address order with the Post Office.
>
> b.  The CMRA must remail mail intended for the addressee (customer) for at least 6 months after the termination date of the agency relationship between the CMRA and addressee. Mail that is remailed by the CMRA requires new postage. This remailing obligation need not be fulfilled if the CMRA customer provides written instructions to the CMRA that the mail (or specific types of mail) not be remailed upon termination of the relationship. This instruction may be provided in an internal service agreement between the customer and CMRA or by a separate document. Written instructions from the customer regarding the handling of this mail must not stipulate that the CMRA refuse mail or return it to sender, or hold the mail during the 6-month remail period and return it to the Post Office, or redeposit mail in the mails without new postage. At the end of the 6-month remail period the CMRA may return to the Post Office only First-Class Mail, First-Class Package Service --- Retail, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, accountable mail, or USPS Retail Ground received for the former addressee (customer). The CMRA must return this mail to the Post Office the next business day after receipt with this endorsement: "Undeliverable, Commercial Mail Receiving Agency, No Authorization to Receive Mail for this Addressee." This mail is returned to the Post Office without new postage. The CMRA must not deposit return mail in a collection box. The CMRA must give the return mail to the letter carrier or return it to the Post Office responsible for delivery to the CMRA. Upon request, the agent must provide to the USPS all addresses to which the CMRA remails mail.
>
> c.  If mail is remailed by the CMRA to the address of a former customer during the 6-month remail period and returned by the USPS endorsed "Moved, Left No Address," then the CMRA may return that mail to the Post Office with the approval of the postmaster or station manager. The approval is subject to evidence that the mail was remailed with new postage to the former customer at the address provided when the relationship was terminated and/or the verified home or business permanent address provided on the customer's Form 1583. Upon approval, the CMRA may return to the Post Office only First-Class Mail, First-Class Package Service --- Retail, Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express, accountable mail, and USPS Retail Ground received for the former customer. The CMRA must return this mail to the Post Office the next business day after receipt without new postage.
>
> d.  The CMRA must provide to the postmaster a quarterly list (due January 15th, April 15th, July 15th, and October 15th) of its customers in alphabetical order cross-referenced to the CMRA addressee delivery designation. The alphabetical list must contain all new customers, current customers, and those customers who terminated within the past 6 months, including the date of termination.
>
> e.  A CMRA may not refuse delivery of mail if the mail is for an addressee who is a customer or former customer (within the past 6 months). The agreement between the addressee and the CMRA obligates the CMRA to receive all mail, except restricted delivery, for the addressee. The addressee may authorize the CMRA in writing on Form 1583 (block 5) to receive restricted delivery mail for the addressee.
>
> f.  If the CMRA has no Form 1583 on file for the intended addressee, the CMRA must return that mail to the Post Office responsible for delivery with this endorsement: "Undeliverable, Commercial Mail Receiving Agency, No Authorization to Receive Mail for this Addressee." This mail is returned to the Post Office without new postage. The CMRA must return misdelivered mail the next business day after receipt.
>
> g.  The CMRA must not deposit return mail in a collection box. The CMRA must give the return mail to the letter carrier or return it to the Post Office responsible for delivery to the CMRA.

#### 1.8.4 Office Business Center Acting as a CMRA

> The procedures for an office business center (OBC) or part of its operation acting as a CMRA for postal purposes are as follows:
> 
> a.  An OBC is a business that operates primarily to provide private office facilities and other business support services to individuals or firms (customers). OBCs receive single-point delivery. OBC customers that receive mail at the OBC address will be considered CMRA customers for postal purposes under the standards set forth in 1.8.4b. Parties considered CMRA customers under this provision must comply with the standards set forth in 1.8.1 through 1.8.3. An OBC must register as a CMRA on Form 1583-A and comply with all other CMRA standards if one or more customers receiving mail through its address is considered a CMRA customer.
>
> b.  An OBC customer is considered to be a CMRA customer for postal purposes if its written agreement with the OBC provides for mail service only or mail and other business support services (without regard for occupancy or other services that the OBC might provide). Additionally, an OBC customer receiving mail at the OBC address is considered to be a CMRA customer for postal purposes if each of the following is true:
>
>     1.  The customer's written agreement with the OBC does not provide for the full-time use of one or more of the private offices within the OBC facility.
>
>     2.  The customer's written agreement with the OBC does not provide all of the following: (a) the use of one or more of the private offices within the facility for at least 16 hours per month at market price for the location; (b) full-time receptionist service and live personal telephone answering service during normal business hours and voicemail service after hours; (c) a listing in the office directory in the building in which the OBC is located; (d) use of conference rooms and other business services on demand, such as secretarial services, word processing, administrative services, meeting planning, travel arrangements, and video conferencing.
>
> c.  Notwithstanding any other standards, a customer whose written agreement provides for mail services only or mail and other business support services will not be considered an OBC customer (without regard for occupancy or other services that an OBC may provide and bill for on demand).
>
> d.  The USPS may request from the OBC copies of written agreements or any other documents or information needed to determine compliance with these standards. Failure to provide requested documents or information might be basis for suspending delivery service to the OBC under the procedures set forth in 1.8.2.
